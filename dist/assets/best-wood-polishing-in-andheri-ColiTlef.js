<h3><strong>What is Wood Polishing?</strong></h3>
<p>Wood polishing is a <strong>finishing process</strong> that restores shine, protects wood, and enhances its natural grains. Unlike <strong>painting</strong>, which covers the wood’s natural design, polishing highlights the wood’s beauty while strengthening its surface.</p>
<p>Traditionally, polishing was done with natural oils and waxes. Over time, advanced methods like <strong>melamine, PU, and French polishing</strong> have made furniture finishes stronger, shinier, and longer-lasting.</p>
