<h3>Understanding Different Types of Wood Finishes</h3>

<p>Before you choose a polish, it's important to identify the finish on your furniture. Most modern furniture has a hard, durable finish like polyurethane, varnish, or lacquer. Older, antique pieces might have a softer oil or shellac finish.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Surface Finishes (Polyurethane, Varnish, Lacquer):</strong> These sit on top of the wood. They are durable and water-resistant. You should use a cleaning polish on these, not an oil.</li>
  <li><strong>Penetrating Finishes (Tung Oil, Linseed Oil):</strong> These soak into the wood. They require periodic re-oiling to prevent the wood from drying out.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> To test your finish, place a drop of water on an inconspicuous spot. If it beads up, you have a hard surface finish. If it soaks in, you have an oil finish.</p>

<h3>Types of Wood Polish</h3>

<p>Here’s a breakdown of the most common types of polish you'll find.</p>

<h4>1. Cleaning Polishes (Emulsion Polishes)</h4>
<p>These are the most common types of polishes available in sprays or liquids. They are a mix of oils, solvents, and surfactants.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Furniture with a hard, modern finish (polyurethane, varnish, lacquer).</li>
  <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Excellent for cleaning away dust, fingerprints, and grime. They are easy to apply and leave a nice shine.</li>
  <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Can leave a buildup over time if not used sparingly. Look for silicone-free options to avoid a hazy film.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Oil-Based Polishes</h4>
<p>These are typically made from linseed oil, tung oil, or lemon oil.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Unfinished or oil-finished wood. They are great for nourishing wood and restoring its natural luster.</li>
  <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Penetrate the wood to prevent it from drying and cracking. Gives a deep, rich glow.</li>
  <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Should <strong>not</strong> be used on furniture with a hard finish, as the oil won't penetrate and will leave a greasy, dust-attracting layer.</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Wax Polishes</h4>
<p>Available in paste or liquid form, wax provides a hard, durable, and long-lasting protective layer.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Best for:</strong> All wood types, especially antiques. It offers excellent protection.</li>
  <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Creates a beautiful, low-sheen luster and protects against spills and scratches.</li>
  <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires more effort to apply. It needs to be buffed well and should only be applied once or twice a year. Over-application can lead to a cloudy buildup.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What to Avoid</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Silicone:</strong> Many popular spray polishes contain silicone. While it creates a glossy, slick surface, it can build up and make future refinishing difficult.</li>
  <li><strong>High-Alkaline Cleaners:</strong> Never use all-purpose kitchen cleaners or ammonia-based products on your wood furniture. They can strip the finish.</li>
  <li><strong>Too Much Product:</strong> More is not better. Using too much polish of any kind will result in a sticky, dulling buildup.</li>
</ul>
